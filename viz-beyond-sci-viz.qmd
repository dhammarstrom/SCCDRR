# Beyond scientific graphs

### Labels, annotations and special texts

A package called `ggtext` makes it possible to write markdown syntax in labels and annotation in ggplots. This improves usability to a large degree as subscripts and superscrits together with special characters are easily added to labels etc. 

Sometimes custom fonts are needed. Your basic collection of fonts are not that impressive but packages such as `showtext` may help in installing additional fonts.



```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| code-summary: "Code producing the figure"
#| fig-cap: "Adding a silly font to a basic graph"


library(showtext)

font_add_google(name = "Permanent Marker", 
                family = "permanentmarker") # <1>
showtext_auto()


leg_leanmass |>
  filter(include != "excl") |>
  mutate(time = factor(time, 
                       levels = c("pre", "post"))) |>

ggplot(aes(time, lean_mass, fill = volume)) + 
         geom_boxplot() +
  
  labs(x = "Time", 
       y = "Leg lean\nmass (g)", 
       fill = "Volume condition", 
       title = "The plot title", 
       subtitle = "The plot subtitle", 
       caption = "the plot caption") +
  
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Pre\nintervention", 
                                  "Post\nintervention")) +
  
  
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), 
        legend.position = "top",
        plot.title = element_text(color = "black", 
                                  family = "permanentmarker", # <2>
                                  size = 40))


```

1. This "installs" the font on your system.
2. Specifying a font family, use your own specified name to access it.




### Glamorous graphics

In a talk at RStudio conference in 2020, Will Chase presented principles related to glamorous graphics. In contrast to Tufte's principles (discussed above), glamorous graphics suggest adding ink to increase the attractiveness of graphics. (This might be a topic for a later workshop).

<!-- 
Why glamorous graphics? - Engage a wider audience - Aesthetics matters for understanding - "respecting the audience"

The glamour of graphics uses color, typography and layout to increase the impact of the graphic.

### Layout

#### Alignment

Top left align titles

Text should be horizontal

Axis labels should also be horizontal

Alignment should provide clean lines and symmetry

Some alignment can be left/center/right to provide overall structure to the graph.

#### Border, Grid lines, legends

Do not use borders or grid lines. If grid lines, make them lighter and more subtle.

Avoid legends, labels of the data are better or titles with color.

#### White space

Use white space to separate elements of the graph and give the reader room to understand the graph.

### Typography

#### Fonts

#### Hierarchy

This gives the reader a hierarchy of information.

### Color

What colors look good together?

```{r}

# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Create a data frame of angles and radii
angles <- seq(0, 360, by = 0.1)
radii <- seq(0.1, 1, by = 0.1)  # Vary the starting point to avoid a point at the center
df <- expand.grid(angle = angles, radius = radii)

# Create ggplot of colored points in polar coordinates
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = angle, y = radius, color = angle, alpha = radius)) +
  geom_point(size = 8) +
  scale_color_gradientn(colors = rainbow(360)) +
  scale_alpha_continuous(range = c(1, 0.1)) +
  coord_polar(theta = "x") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none")
  

#### Alternative

# Create a data frame of angles from 0 to 360
angles <- seq(0, 360, by = 0.2)
df <- data.frame(angle = angles)

# Create ggplot of colored points in polar coordinates
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = angle, y = 1, color = angle)) +
  geom_point(size = 10) +
  scale_color_gradientn(colors = rainbow(360)) +
  coord_polar(theta = "x") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none")

```

The color wheel can be used to find

-   Complementary colors that will give high contrast
-   Monochromatic will give harmonious\
-   Analogous are choosen from the same side on the color wheele colors to avoid contrast but still enable showing differences
-   Triadic colors to give more

#### Describing colors, Hue, Saturation and Lightness

#### Background colors

Colors can help reduce "hardness" by avoiding a white background.-->
